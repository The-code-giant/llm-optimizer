# LLM Optimizer - Project Status Report

## 1. Project Summary

**Goal:** The primary objective of the LLM Optimizer project is to increase the visibility and citation of user websites by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. This is achieved by analyzing website content for LLM readiness and providing easy-to-implement recommendations and content injection capabilities, specifically targeting non-technical Marketing Managers and Founders.

**Current Phase:** [e.g., Development, Testing, Deployment Planning, Live]

**Estimated Completion (MVP):** [Date]

- Project initiation in progress: TypeScript backend (Drizzle, PostgreSQL), Next.js frontend.
- Backend and frontend scaffolding complete. Next: implement API and data models in TypeScript/Drizzle.
- Clerk authentication integration in progress for frontend; documentation updated in memory files.

## 2. Implementation Progress

Provide a high-level status for each core MVP feature:

- **Tracker Script:**
  - Status: [e.g., In Development, Code Complete, Testing, Deployed]
  - Details: [Brief description, e.g., Basic tracking implemented, Needs integration with backend API]
- **Sitemap Import:**
  - Status: [e.g., Not Started, In Development, Code Complete, Testing]
  - Details: [Brief description, e.g., XML parsing logic defined, Dashboard integration pending]
- **AI Analysis Engine:**
  - Status: [e.g., Model Selection, Integration In Progress, Analysis Logic Complete, Testing]
  - Details: [Brief description, e.g., API integration with [LLM Provider] established, Recommendation logic being refined]
- **Content Injection Module:**
  - Status: [e.g., Design Phase, Development In Progress, Basic Injection Logic Complete]
  - Details: [Brief description, e.g., Dashboard UI for injection designed, Script communication with site needs testing]
- **User Dashboard:**
  - Status: [e.g., UI/UX Design Complete, Frontend Development In Progress, Backend API Integration]
  - Details: [Brief description, e.g., Core page views (Pages, Analysis Results) built, Settings section pending]

## 3. Testing Status

Summarize the current state of Quality Assurance efforts:

- **Overall QA Status:** [e.g., Test Planning, Unit Testing In Progress, Integration Testing Starting, Ready for UAT, UAT In Progress]
- **Key Areas Tested:** [e.g., Tracker script data collection, Sitemap parsing, Basic AI analysis API calls]
- **Bugs Identified (This Period):** [Number]
- **Bugs Resolved (This Period):** [Number]
- **Critical Bugs Open:** [Number]
- **Notes:** [Any specific testing challenges or successes]
